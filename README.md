# Lucid-App

### What is lucid?
Cognitive processing is easily affected by environmental stimulation that distracts attention. lucid is a mindful implication of brown noise for better concentration and relaxation.

### How do we solve this?
lucid uses the baseline of how our brains respond as we complete tasks in different environments by changing background noises.
